#### üöÄ Key Highlights

* **Revolutionary Tracking Algorithm** ‚Äì Combines **MTCNN face detection**, **FaceNet embeddings**, and a custom **Batch-Optimized FastMTCNN** pipeline.

  * *Novel batching technique*: processes frames in groups, skipping redundant frames with little or no motion.
  * *Background subtraction optimization*: ensures computation is focused only where changes occur.
  * *Strided detection*: detects faces at intervals while preserving accuracy, achieving speed-ups without quality loss.
* **Multi-Camera Synchronization** ‚Äì Automatically stitches clips from different cameras into a single, timeline-accurate video.
* **High Accuracy & Performance** ‚Äì Achieves **\~90.5% accuracy** with up to **42 FPS** on GPU-powered systems.
* **Real-Time Capability** ‚Äì Designed to function in near real-time, enabling scalable deployment in security systems.

#### üìÇ Workflow(code and explaination for same is in [fast-mtcnn-detector-55-fps-at-full-resolution-new.ipynb](https://github.com/divyanshsood00/human_tracking_through_CCTV_systems/blob/main/fast-mtcnn-detector-55-fps-at-full-resolution-new.ipynb))

1. **Input**: Suspect image(s) + synchronized CCTV video feeds
2. **Preprocessing**: Frame batching + background subtraction to eliminate redundancy
3. **Face Detection (MTCNN)** ‚Üí **Face Recognition (FaceNet embeddings + Cosine Similarity)**
4. **Tracking**: Frames with positive matches are extracted and aligned by timestamp
5. **Output**: A consolidated video showing the suspect‚Äôs activity across all cameras

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, NumPy, Imutils**
* **MTCNN + FaceNet** for deep learning-based face detection and recognition
* **CUDA acceleration** for high-performance GPU processing

---

#### ‚úÖ Testing & Results

* Detects **frontal, partial (side) faces** reliably
* Handles **multiple videos, multiple faces, and complex backgrounds**
* Produces **timestamped unified video output** of the tracked individual
* **Average Accuracy:** 90.47% across test cases
* **Results can be observed in output_ files in output videos folder:** [human_tracking_through_CCTV_systems/videos-outputs/cafefirst/](https://github.com/divyanshsood00/human_tracking_through_CCTV_systems/tree/main/videos-outputs/cafefirst)
